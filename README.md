1.	Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
I created an inventory app which would allow users to sign in, create a new account, add items, and receive notification updates. This was meant to address the needs of users who ran or worked for companies. Through this app users could track their inventory items and view how much of each they had. Because it sends notifications they can also know when an item is getting low.  

2.	What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The app opened up to a login screen. Here users could login or choose to create a new account. If they chose to create a new account then they would be taken to a new screen. This screen allowed users to input information such as their email and a password. Once logged in users were taken to the inventory screen. Here they could choose to add products and specify the amount. The UI was designed to be easy to navigate. It was set up similar to many apps so users would be familiar with how to log in. It was also relatively simple so users would not struggle to find whatever they were looking for. 

3.	How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I created the code in steps. Each screen needed its own functionality, as well as connected with others. I had to plan out the hierarchy of my app so it would be most efficient and manageable. I started by writing down the functionality and screens that would be needed, as well as how they would work off of each other. After this I started coding while focusing on the functionality that was at the top of the hierarchy first. I then built off of that, making sure to test with each new addition to ensure it worked. 

4.	How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I tested using the emulator functionality in Android Studios. This was immensely helpful as it helped me see exactly how my screens looked to users as well as what it was like to move through the app. This helped me find bugs such as issues with my login and adding new products functionality.  

5.	Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
As this was my first time working with Android Studios there were a few challenges I faced, especially when it came to formatting. The Android Developers website was immensely helpful in overcoming formatting challenges. 

6.	In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I feel the apps functionality to add products was successful in demonstrating my knowledge, skills, and experience. This is because I had to create formatting that was easy for users to use. I also had to make sure my code would add, store, and display products. It also had to connect to the appâ€™s other screens. This was definitely the most difficult part of the app for me.
